Nearing the end of the storm after nearly 50 years engulfed in a continent wide dust storm. Some light (natural sun)
was finally seeping through the sky-glass of the shelters

An entire generation of Marians have crossed the era of Dust storm of 2950-3000.  With advanced forecasting predictions
the growing storm almost a 100 years ago in 2800. 

Large-scale shelters were designed & built as far as possible from the Eye of the storm. Almost a 100years of building 
a new marvel of the solar system. It helped humanity as a whole since Space technology greatly improved for use
in inhospitable planets.

Necessity is the mother of all inventions. With the simulation & prototype tools available for everyone on Mars,
Knowledge & Intellect is not restricted to an area or clustered around companies. 
Designs were tested regularly to harvest the ferocity of the wind to power all activities on Mars.
Different prototype were tested all across the plains of Vidyanagar. 

From the main idea of protecting life , designs were built based on 1st principles
* Habitat Protection
* Food productions - Freeze and Dry
* Animal Husbandry - Meatless Meat - 3D printed food
* Activity fields - Tracks, Sports fields
