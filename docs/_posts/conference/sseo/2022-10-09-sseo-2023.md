### Title
Autonomous Greenhouse with Swarm robots for Mars Exploration

### Goal
Increase Habitable Mars Days for Human Exploration

### Proposal
Bhoomi is a swarm robotics platform to build Habitats. Each robot
in the swarm is independent and completes functional requirements autonomously.
Multiple robots collaborate to complete a complex task. Robots consist of
Unmanned Ground Vehicles(UGV/Rover), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles(UAV/Quadcopter),
Humanoid(Digital twin). VR map model is generated by the Habitat Monitor system for real time
visualization and tracking progress of robots. Each robot has a fallback position, for human operator to
intervene for complex task process

### Solution

* The system will generate layouts for Habitat modules and provide Assistance and monitoring to Martial explorers.
* Priority designed through "Goal" process designed by Dr. Eli Goldratt
* Based on mission duration ( 4 years minimum - due to orbital sync of Earth to Mars transfer orbit).
* Fresh and local grown food is necessary for Sustenance and survival of crew members.
* The system will monitor the green house and provide information to Mission specialist

### System Priority
* 3D Tools Printing
* Night/Winter Shelter : Low temperature
* Green House : Nutrition and Sustenance with Hydroponics
* Power Generation : Solar Farms
* Landing/Launch Zone : Reusable Rockets for Logistics and Supplies


<h4>3D Tools</h4>
For the Habitat's Greenhouse Module. Below tools have to be 3D printed
<ul>
    <li>Metal Cutter/Shearer : To repurpose landing gear shell for walls and compartments </li>
    <li>Exercise Equipment : Weight + Dumbbells - With hollow compartments to fill with Martion legolith increase weight</li>
    <li>Photo Frames : Mental Health and sense of belonging to mission and life</li>
    <li>Portable Water Dispenser : Needle septum at Galley and Greenhouse</li>
    <li>Rubber/Soft Mallet : Bend materials into shape for building compartment from Re-used shells and 3D printer boards</li>
    <li>Wires - Thick filaments to hold items into places </li>
    <li>Cutlery/Garden Tools : Scissors, knife, Screw Driver - Standard head </li>
</ul >

<ul>
 <li>3D printer - Print the items based on Prioritised order received from the Habitat Control System</li>
 <li>Rover to pick the items from 3D printer and to stack it at sub-module location.</li>
 <li>When the items required for a sub-module are complete. Astronaut build the module with logistic support of Rover</li>
 </ul>

<h4>Re-Usable Component from I-Hab</h4>
<ul>
<li>Crew Systems:</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Galley for warming food and dining</li>
  <li>Personal Crew Compartments providing private area for sleeping</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Crew Health Performance Subsystem:</li>
 <ul>
  <li>Environmental monitoring (acoustic, radiation, chemical hazards)</li>
  <li>Exercise area</li>
  <li>Medical care</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Docking ports:</li>
  <ul>
   <li>Two axial ports for attachment to the Gateway</li>
   <li>Two ports radially for vehicles</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
