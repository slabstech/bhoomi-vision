# Habitat Guidelines

## Layout

- Smaller Volume with well laid out elements
- Additional volume can be provided to facilitate minimal interference, privacy and noise reduction
- Volume can also be given if it improves overall design efficiency
- “Clean” areas include crew quarters, galley, and science and medical workspaces. “Dirty” areas include the WCS, hygiene,
and exercise spaces. Separate both
- Should have stability aids (e.g., handholds, foot restraints,
and body restraints), mobility aids (including an adequate mounting structures), and temporary
stowage accommodations (e.g., Velcro, bungees, nets, and caddies)
- Window can be provided

## Crew Quarters

- Should be in a clean area
- incorporate a rigid enclosure and door, light and sound proofing, adjust-
able ventilation (air flow speed and direction that is adjustable for personal preference and to mit-
igate CO2 buildup), caution and warning indicators (audible and visual), power and data connec-
tions (for laptops, tablets, task lighting, general charging), peripheral mounts (for laptops and tab-
lets), customizable mood and spot lighting (relocatable, adjustable color/brightness), flexible tem-
porary stowage (e.g., Velcro, bungees, nets, caddies), adjustable sleeping bag positioning (both
orientation and location within the crew quarter), and direct access to any additional personal crew
storage lockers from within the crew quarters
- Dimensions - 30”wide x 30” deep and > 78” long

## Hygiene

- Must be in a dirty area
- Cross contamination must be considered
- Fecilitate easy cleaning
- Suffcient ventilation
- Dimensions - ~45” wide x 30” deep x 78” tall

## Waste collection system
- Dirty area
- Separate area for storing long term trash
- Odors must be correctly managed. Incorporate trace contaminant control system
- Dimensions -  ~40” wide x 30” deep x 78” tall

## Exercise

- Device needs to be mounted on the vibration isolation system (VIS)
- Dirty Aread
- Adequate ventilation to be provided to prevent CO2 buildup

## Galley and Galley Table

- Clean area
- hot and cold PWDs, food warmers, cold storage, local
stowage for one week’s worth of food, and a galley table large enough for all crew to gather to-
gether to eat a meal
- at least 22” wide x 50” long


## Trash Management

- Removal of trash every 30 days
- Wet and dry trash to be packed separately
- Volume - approx 36 ft cube

## Multipurpose workstations

- Small work surfaces, mounts, and temporary stowage accommodations (e.g. Velcro, bungees, nets,
pockets, etc.) should be provided near multipurpose workstations

## Dedicated Science Workspaces and Surfaces

- Might be dirty or clean area depending on the task
- Glove box

## Dedicated Medical Workspaces and Surface

- Can be a clean area
- Need not be dedicated, other surfaces can be multipurpose used

## Crew Common Area

- Area for entertainment, holding meetings etc.

## Logistics Stowage and Location Referencing

- Coding scheme along with storage tracking to be enabled
- Scheme should be defined

## Lighting

- Sufficient warning indicators with clear lighting 

## In flight maintenance

## Radiation Protection

- rapid access to adequate protection from solar particle events (SPEs)
- Separate area not required, crew can construct when required

## Multipurpose air locks
