## Vision Abstract

Vision sensors have been employed on the drone for monitoring the greenhouse present in the habitat. The data from the device, which inputs side and top view images, is processed by the computer vision module and results are reported to the base station. The functional parameters reported back to base are the live count of leaves, disease detection, growth measurement and soil moisture values. This work shows the pipeline integrating the computer vision module along with the inputs by the proposed drone navigation method.
