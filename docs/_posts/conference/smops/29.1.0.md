# Insights on the Proposed Abstract

The abstract proposes the Bhoomi platform where a set of robots where individual systems achieve consensus and complete functional requirements in a coordinated manner. The entire process is monitored by the Habitat Monitoring system which tracks the jobs completed and visualizes the functionalities performed in real time.
From NASA IHAB the following systems have been incorporated,

- Crew Systems
- Crew Health Performance Subsystem
- Docking Ports
- Phenotype Plan Growth requirements
- Greenhouse â€“ This has been proposed along with the items required and the schedule which is to be followed to grow food produce

The items required by the respective systems are printed by the 3D printer. Astronauts build the module with the logistics provided by a Rover.

## Questions

- I think important design parameters that have been considered in previous habitat designs have to be mentioned
- What missions is this greenhouse design made for?
- Feasibility of the greenhouse design
- Computational considerations/ challenges for Bhoomi in building such a greenhouse
