<ul>
   <li>For Greenhouse Maintenance<br>
    In this approach, A filled syringe is attached to the underbody of a micro-aerial drone. <br>
    The plunger is activated to spray the liquid using an electro-mechanical actuator.<br>
    The target area is set based on the type of plant. Using CV the individual leaf/stalk is identified and predetermined quantity is sprayed.<br>
    Usage of insecticide for agriculture has a destructive effect of the soil.<br>
    The existing method of using body-mounted hand-pump based system is inefficient in terms of 1. Insecticide quantity used. 2. Square area of land covered<br>
    The inefficiency is are dependent of the factors below
    <ul>
     <li>Human error</li>
     <li>Wind direction</li>
     <li>Distance between plants</li>
     <li>Height of plants</li>
     <li>Type of plants viz., large leaf, small leaf</li>
     <li>Spray Nozzle</li>
    </ul>
    On a conservative method/approach, the insecticide is sprayed ineffectively over an area due to human error or field of view. The error is could a due to a combination of factors viz.,
    <ul>
     <li>Fatigue</li>
     <li>Region of interest as a small dense area, cumbersome to traverse</li>
     <li>Reduced plant to plant coverage due to height of plants</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
