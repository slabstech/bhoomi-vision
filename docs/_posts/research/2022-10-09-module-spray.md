### Clean Solar Array
* Maintenance Swarm Drones which clean the dust of Solar Array Panels in remote locations autonomously. 
* The rotor wash of the drone's propeller would be directed at the panels to blow away the minute dirt accumulated throughout the day.<br>
* Using Vision Position System(VPS) the grids would be assigned to individual drones based on its health parameters. <br>
* Using 2/3 wide angle camera lens, 360 deg view would be constantly monitored for SLAM.<br>
* Autonomous drones would be wireless charged during excess peak output to conserve energy for critical systems.<br>

### Dispenser 
* The intended deployment would be initial Mars Landing, where Autonomous systems build a minimum viable habitation facility.<br>
* The algorithm can be customised to replace the fuel based hand held leaf blower locally.<br>
* We demonstrate the working of the Autonomous system and also the fail-safe mechanism required for uninterrupted power generation<br>
