### Sprint Logs 

* Sprint 29 - Nov  20 - 2022 to 26 Nov  2022 
  * Questions
    - I think important design parameters that have been considered in previous habitat designs have to be mentioned
    - What missions is this greenhouse design made for?
    - Feasibility of the greenhouse design
    - Computational considerations/ challenges for Bhoomi in building such a greenhouse
  * Answers

    * We start with clean design. For first prototype we expect the habitat to be ready and built by others. 
      We will focus our design on Greenhouse on priority. Sensor modules would be re-used interchangeably 
      with the Habitat and Greenhouse
    * Greenhouse design for food output should meet [https://www.deepspacefoodchallenge.org/](https://www.deepspacefoodchallenge.org/) requirements

    * Feasibility study will be done through Simulation in MuJoCo , Cost/Bill of materials should be created.
    * Greenhouse computing would be trialed in AstroPi setup for fixed sensors. Design for Mobile robots to be done in the future.

* PR modifications
  * For documentation, we will use Markdown file format. It's simple to track via git for modifications and requires only a text editor.
    Please update the PR by converting the pdf to Markdown file.
  * @sachinsshetty will create a template for PR creations, it will be ready by next sprint
  Source code map needs to be created by @sachinsshetty , for navigation to new contributions  
  * Document location could be  bhoomi/docs/_posts/conference/smops , since we are planning to submit an abstract for
  SMOPS 2023 at the end of sprint.
